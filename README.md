Otherwise you need to implement it using WSDL in this assignment, and include the following components in your submission. You need to show important design decisions you make, key algorithms and data structures you used (if any), and the platform (e.g., software, hardware) based on which the system is implemented. You also need to show screenshots of the execution of your system.2. A working prototype of the system. You can use any platform or IDE you feel comfortable with as long as you clearly report these details in the project report. Submit the source code along with instructions how to execute your system. Note that the input (queries on the flight availability) and output (response to queries) can be written in any of the following formats: XML file, plain text file, or system I/O. The system can be tested on a live web server, or on a simulated environment such as a local host.
